You can create these files by:

1. **requirements.txt**: Create a new file in your project folder and paste the contents above.
2. **README.md**: Create another file named `README.md` in the same folder and paste the above markdown into it.

Once these are added to your project, **other users** can easily set up the environment by just running the `pip install -r requirements.txt` command. ðŸŽ‰

Let me know if you need any further customizations!
